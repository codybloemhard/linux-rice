# Hawkrad
Hawkrad is just solarized dark with a different, darker and greyer background colour as well as the bright colours just being the normal colours.
- Bright is the same as normal colours because I use bold=bright
- Darker more grey background because... I like this better
## About the name
If you change the colours of a colour scheme you can't name it the same anymore sinds it's different now.
Thus I need a new name. Because I made the background darker I was thinking Solarized Void.
But I don't want Solarized in the name because I don't know if the author likes it when I changed the colours.
Solarized made my think about radiation and Void makes me think about black holes.
And I came to Hawkrad which is just Hawking Radiation but compressed.
