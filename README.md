# Cody's Linux Rice (Artix / Arch / Void)

## Maintained?

* Artix: Yes, I use this rice on my Artix desktop daily
* Arch: Kinda, after some minor tweaks it should be fine on Arch.
* Void: No, the config is outdated.

Currently moving away from i3-gaps into ringwm.
I3 is only used as backup right now.
Bar config is already less compatible with i3.
To be removed after the testing period.

## About

- A minimal but useable desktop environment for my personal use.

# Install

## Install Rice:

0. Assuming you have internet access now and you only have artix installed.
1. Login as a normal user.
2. Install git (or include it in pacstrap): `sudo pacman -S git`
3. Make a dir for all git projects: `mkdir ~/git`
4. Goto the new dir: `cd ~/git`
5. Pull this repo(assuming you read this on another device): `git clone https://gitlab.com/codybloemhard/linux-rice.git`
6. `cd ~/git/linux-rice/artix`
8. Give exec rights: `chmod +x calr.sh`
9. Run it `./calr.sh`
10. It does stuff(installing and copying config files).
11. You now have the programs, my configs, repos installed, system updated etc.
12. `startx` to start the x server.

### Configure wifi (wpa, optional):

0. View your network interfaces `sudo ip link show`
1. Pick your interface, called _interface from now.
2. List all networks by running `sudo iw dev interface scan | grep -i ssid`
3. Pick one called _ssid from now.
4. You know the password for the network, called _key from now.
5. Backup example conf: `cp /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-std.conf`
6. Populate the conf with our data. `wpa_passphrase _ssid _key >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
7. For some reason had to do `killall wpa_applicant`;
8. `wpa_supplicant -B -i<interface_name> -c<path/to/configuration/file> -Dwext`
9. `dhcpcd _interface`
10. Should work now, `pacman -Syu` and `ping somewebsite` should work.
11. If not, i also had to repeat some steps. If it prompts that it has this file in /usr/.... after step 10, just remove it with `rm filename`. and repeat step 10.

### Confige wifi (connmanctl, optional):

0. `connmanctl`
1. `enable wifi`
2. `scan wifi`
3. `agent on`
4. `connect wifi_...`

### Some tid bits

- mount boot partition to `/mnt/boot`, but install grub with `grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=grub`
- If you use grub and it boots to an grub terminal instead of the menu, boot from usb again, arch-chroot into your system, install grub with `--removable` flag.
- when chrooted in, install `pacman -S iwd dhcpcd` as they are only present at the install iso and not in your fresh system.
- Install sudo `pacman -S sudo`
- Make a normal user `useradd -m username` and set password `passwd username`
- Add user as sudoer `su -c visudo`, scroll down till you see `root ALL=(ALL) ALL`, add under that line `username ALL=(ALL) ALL`
